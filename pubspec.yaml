# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # The version of your MSIX package. It should generally align with your
  # app's version (from the `version:` field above, e.g., 1.0.0)

  # The last digit is often used for MSIX package revisions if the app code hasn't changed.
  msix_version: 1.0.0.1 # Should match/increment with your app version

  # Path to your application's logo.
  # A .png (e.g., 256x256px or 512x512px) is recommended as MSIX can generate various required sizes.
  # You can use the existing .ico: "windows\\runner\\resources\\app_icon.ico"
  # Or, create a new one, e.g., "assets\\icon\\app_icon.png" (and ensure this file exists).

  # Capabilities your app needs. Uncomment and add as necessary.
  # If your app uses the internet (e.g., for fetching data, updates):
  # capabilities: "internetClient, location" # Add capabilities your app needs
  # For most local/sideloaded apps, 'store: false' (or omitting it) is correct.
  # Set to true ONLY if you are preparing this for the Microsoft Store.
  # store: false # Keep false or remove for non-Store distribution
  # If you have an official code signing certificate:
  # certificate_path: C:\path\to\your\official_certificate.pfx
  # certificate_password: your_certificate_password
